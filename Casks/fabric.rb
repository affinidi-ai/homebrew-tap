# The fabric CLI cask, rendered by scripts/homebrew-cask.sh in
# affinidi-ai/affinidi-trust-fabric-cli for one release. The release opens a
# pull request on the tap with this file; it never pushes, and nobody edits
# it by hand. The url is the versioned release archive and each sha256
# comes from the release's SHA256SUMS. There is no postflight and no
# quarantine removal: the binary is Developer ID signed and notarized, so
# Gatekeeper's check of the quarantined download is real.
#
#   brew install --cask affinidi-ai/tap/fabric
