# The boris CLI cask, rendered by clients/homebrew/render.sh for one release
# (docs/AGENT_CONTROL_PHASE3_SPEC.md P40). The release opens a pull request
# on the tap with this file; it never pushes. The url is the immutable,
# versioned archive and each sha256 comes from the signed SHA256SUMS. There is
# no postflight and no quarantine removal: the binary is Developer ID signed
# and notarized, so Gatekeeper's check of the quarantined download is real.
#
#   brew install --cask affinidi-ai/tap/boris
